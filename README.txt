The objective of the game is to use the red ball to knock the enemies off the platform.
Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the red ball. The number displayed on each ball
represents the objects mass. The red ball can be upgraded in the shop. More mass moving
at a higher speed creates more powerful collisions. Acceleration improves the control 
of the ball and its ability to reach top speed.
